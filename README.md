# Front-End Revert Backup and Build with BASH

A simple solution for local control for front-end web development projects.

Designed specifically for managing small to medium sized projects using BASH scripts. 

[HW HTML Drafting Project](https://github.com/dckimMysteryAuthor/HW-HTML-Drafting-Project) is an example of an Open-Source Project which made use of this system. It is clear that with a few minor adaptations, the system of scripts can be utilized in many cases, with myriad benefits, and still along-side GIT.

This is not designed as a replacement for GIT by any means. A possible workflow might be: Make changes locally, and make backups local at will. This way the safety of a complete backup is available locally without needing to rely completely on GIT for recovery after a potentially bad local change. This should promote a more free atmosphere within the local context, and improve control and quality of final commits made through git.

You are just a few tweaks and maybe one script away from possibly aligning this system with a scripted transfer to the local GIT repository.

Whether you choose to work from within the latest chronologically named directory, or write a script to maintain a constant top working directory: That's completely up to you.

## For anyone who is kinda new to web development and has just discovered this:

The struggle is over, and the easy part is now here. You can backup at any time, so you will never step back from the progress you have made. The revert will only take you back a single step but, you can always change into an earlier directory manually and then use the backup script that is inside of that directory. Then that one becomes the top. **Good To Go**.

## As for me? I like it just how it is.

I might change it around a little to see if it can be even better but, you never know how good something is until you try something else and it's bad.
